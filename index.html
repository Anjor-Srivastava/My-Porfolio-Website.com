                <p class="text-left text-capitalize">Karim's Hotel or Karim's is a historic restaurant located near Jama Masjid, Gali Kababian, Old Delhi, Delhi, India. Established in 1913, the restaurant has been described as "synonymous with this area" (Old Delhi) and "arguably the city's most famous culinary destination". Since April 2021 it's also open in the South Indian city of Bangalore. In mid 19th century, Mohammed Aziz was a cook in the royal court of Mughal Emperor, however after the Bahadur Shah Zafar was exiled, he left the city for Meerut and later Ghaziabad. However, in 1911, when Delhi Durbar was held for the coronation of the King George V, one of Aziz's son Haji Karimuddin moved back to Delhi with an innovative idea of opening a Dhaba with the Mughal culinary, to cater the people coming from all over India to join the coronation. Haji Karimuddin started the Dhaba selling just two items of Alu gosht (mutton with potatoes) and Daal (lentil curry) served with Rumali Roti.

                    In 1913, Haji Karimuddin established the Karim Hotel in Gali Kababian, near Jama Masjid, Delhi saying, "I want to earn fame and money by serving the royal food to the common man". The restaurants opened its first branch in 1990s in Nizamuddin West, followed by Kailash Colony, Noida, Gurgaon, Kamla Nagar, Dwarka, Delhi and in all of the Delhi NCR region.

                    Today, the fourth generation is running the show with Karim Hotels Pvt. Ltd. at Jama Masjid, a Restaurant called Dastar Khwan-E-Karim at Nizamuddin West New Delhi .</p>

                <p>This is a delightful film version of the beloved book by Michael Bond. It opens with newsreel footage of the explorer discovering the lost tribe of bears, and then the sweet, polite Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) is sent off after the tragedy that leaves him an orphan, happily finding his new family in London. Bonneville is good as the exasperated and overprotective dad, and Hawkins is adorable as the loving artist mother who takes to Paddington right away.

                <p>A young lion has a lot to learn.

                    Simba is the son of the Prideland’s king, Mufasa. And this cub would do well to pay attention to what his royal pops has to say. After all, there’s a balance in their animal kingdom world that Mufasa is patiently trying to explain. It’s a balance of large and small, good and evil. And that’s big stuff. Life stuff. Simba, however, is more concerned with the fun he might have in an elephant graveyard. So he purposely disobeys his father’s wishes and ventures into the dark land of the giggly but very nasty hyenas.

                    Thankfully, Dad shows up just in time.

                    Simba could also use a little wising up when it comes to his sly-eyed Uncle Scar. Being manipulated by that power-hungry cat could be even worse than messing with hyenas. At least you know when they’re trying to hurt you. Again, Simba is more concerned with practicing his roar than sharpening his wit. So he lets himself be used as bait to draw Mufasa into a horrible trap. A trap of sheer cliffs, a narrow gorge, nipping hyenas and stampeding antelope.

                    And there’s no one to save the day this time.

                    Even though Scar masterminded the whole terrible thing, he turns to his nephew and moans, “Simba, what have you done?” And, of course, the young prince is instantly certain that he indeed is the one to blame. He’s convinced that he must run away. Run away from his guilt and the pain that will fill his mother’s eyes. It’s just the reaction Scar is counting on.

                    Will the guilt-ridden cub ever learn what it takes … to be a lion king?
